# Online-Appendix of *Decision-Focused Learning for Fine-Tuning a Time-Series Foundation Model in Inventory Management*.
This repository contains the online-appendix of the paper *Decision-Focused Learning for Fine-Tuning a Time-Series Foundation Model in Inventory Management*, which is under review for the CPAIOR 2026 conference.    

The complete appendix can be found in the pdf-file.
In appendix A the histogram of the mean values of the time-series is displayed.
In appendix B an overview over the selected values for different hyperparameters is given.  

Appendix C contains the CDF plots referenced in section 6 of the paper, including a short description and analysis of them. 
The CDF plots highlight what proportion of the instance set can be solved by the different methods with induced scaled costs (OSPEC) below any given value on the x-axis.  

Finally, Appendix D shows the bivariate plot referenced in section 6 of the paper. 
In the bivariate plot the costs (OSPEC) obtained after decision-focused fine-tuning (DFF) are plotted against the corresponding costs obtained after prediction-focused fine-tuning.
